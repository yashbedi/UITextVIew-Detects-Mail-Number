# TextView With Email And Number

- Textview works kinda UILabel where Numbers and Emails are clickable and UITextView is Non-Editable.

- A 100% Working code, Works perfectly on Devices, Simulators I cant Gurantee. 


# Opens Call App and MailComposer

- This code is configured to open a Call app such that you can Caller Number in the TextView and It Automatically Detects it as a number and opens call screen,

- Opens MFMailComposer for writing mails directly if added an Email in the TextView.
